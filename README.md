## Overview

### Where can I see your demo?

### What have you learned/improved?
Building this app was a great experience, I learned a lot about Material UI, for example how to use the built-in components, their icons, and hw to apply personal styles.
Also, it was awesome to use the react google map library, that allows you to add a lot of functionalities. Finally, by using RapidAPI travel advisor REST API I learned more about the good practices and concepts for fetching data and displaying it.
